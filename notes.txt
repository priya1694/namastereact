to configure local repository to remote follow the below steps:-
* git init
* git branch -M main
* git add .
* git commit -m "message"
* if doing for first time (git remote add origin https://github.com/priya1694/namastereact.git )
* git push origin main

npm - does not have a full form (it manages a package)
it is standard repository for packages.

package.json is the configuartion for npm
packages are also known as dependencies

important package in our project : bundler
bundler bundles or packages the project that will be able to push the project to production

2 types of dependencies:-
dev dependency - required in development phase
normal dependency- used in production also.

^ - updates the minor version updates
~ - updates the major version updates

package-lock.json - keeps track of exact version of the package

node-modules - contains all the code fetched from npm.(data of the dependencies)

transitive dependencies - dependencies involving other dependencies and so on..

package,package-lock should be pushed to git but not node_modules.
if package,package-lock then node modules can be re-generated 
(npm install to re-generate node_modules)

npx - execute a package (npx parcel index.html)

#parcel
* dev build
* created local server
* HMR - hot module replacement(refreshing on its own when saved)
* File watching algorithms written in c++
* caching - faster builds
* Image optimization
* minifaction/bundling of files
* compressing
* consistent hashing(read about it)
* code splitting
* differential bundling - support older browsers
* diagonostic
* better error handling
* HTTPs

To run the react project:-
npm run start/npm start
if you do not know how to run the project go to package.json and see the scripts for start & build

To build the project:-
npm run build

React.createElement =>object =>render(HTMLElement)
React.createElement is an react element which is inturn an object which on rendered to dom creates an htmlElement.

JSX => It is a convention where we merge javascript and html together
JSX is not html in JS 
JSX is html like syntax/just looks like html/xml

eg:- const JSXHeading = <h1 id="heading">hello priya</h1>;
root.render(JSXHeading);

babel -> takes jsx and converts it to the language understood by the js engine.
the conversion happens before sending it to the browser

attribute to jsx must be camelcase: eg:-className.tabIndex etc
jsx code when written in multiple lines should be enclosed within the ()-brackets.

React components:-
* class based components - old way of writing component (javascript classes)
* functional components - new way of writing component (javascript functions)

React functional component is javascript function that returns JSX code/reactElement.

component composition:- component inside another component.
can inject any javascript inside the JSX Code using {}
eg:- const number = 1000;
{number} -> inside jsx code
React Element can be included inside jsx code using {}
component inside component using </>

build food ordering app 
name - namaste food
header =>logo in the header , home,about,add to cart
footer
search and cards in the body

arguments passed to a function is same as props passed in a functional component.

Config driven UI 

note:do not use index as key in react.(map function)
if there is no unique id then use index but it is nor recommended in the first place.

2 types of export :-
default export
named export

when we have to export multiple things use named export.

React Hooks:-
Hook is a normal javascript utility function given by react.
it is used to create super poerful variable known as state in react.
1) useState()
2) useEffect()

whenever a state variable changes, react will re-render the component.

 * useState is a state variable which is used to re-render the data into the ui , whenever the changes is made to the data.
 * whenever local state variable is changed the component is re-rendered.
 * Never create useState variable ouside the components, it is used to create local variable inside the functional components.
 * always try to create state variable at the beginning of the function(higher level function).
 * Never create useState inside an if else statement and for loops , it can create inconsistency in the program.
 * useEffect uses 2 arguments once is the call back and another is the dependency array. eg:- useEffect({()=>},[]); 
 * when the body function renders, it renders and then the call back function will be called and shows whatever is in useEffect.
 * if no depemdency array , useEffect calls on every render.
 * if there is dependency array and it is empty, use effect is called on the intial render(just once)
 * if there is dependency array and it has some value , then whenever that value in a function is called the useEffect renders.



React uses reconciliation algorithm known as react fibre.
virtual DOM(javascript object) is representation of actual DOM


Monolith & microservice architecture.
Monolith arcitecture :- all code like api's , UI , DB, sms everything written at one place and compiled n deployed all of them whenever even a minute change is made in any of them.
microservice :- different services for different of them like api,ui,db,auth etc and all of them communicating with eachother.
* all indiviual services can run on their own porrts and can be connected through the domain name.

2 ways the data can be fetched from the backend/database.
1.as sson as page loads we can make a api call and then render data to the ui
2.as soon as page loads we will render the ui and then make an api call and re-render the data.

in react we will always use the 2nd approach.

conditional rendering :- Rendering based on a condition.


Routing inside react application.
-> React router dom - it is an npm javascript library (to create routes)
to install this package , go to terminal - npm i reat-router-dom
-> create routing configuration inside the app.js
-> UseRouteError is a hook given by react-router-dom
-> link component is a super power given to us by the react-router-dom
-> anchor tag while linking reloads the whole page , while link dont 

Children routes

2 types of routing in webapps:-
client side 
server side
