to configure local repository to remote follow the below steps:-
* git init
* git branch -M main
* git add .
* git commit -m "message"
* if doing for first time (git remote add origin https://github.com/priya1694/namastereact.git )
* git push origin main

npm - does not have a full form (it manages a package)
it is standard repository for packages.

package.json is the configuartion for npm
packages are also known as dependencies

important package in our project : bundler
bundler bundles or packages the project that will be able to push the project to production

2 types of dependencies:-
dev dependency - required in development phase
normal dependency- used in production also.

^ - updates the minor version updates
~ - updates the major version updates

package-lock.json - keeps track of exact version of the package

node-modules - contains all the code fetched from npm.(data of the dependencies)

transitive dependencies - dependencies involving other dependencies and so on..

package,package-lock should be pushed to git but not node_modules.
if package,package-lock then node modules can be re-generated 
(npm install to re-generate node_modules)

npx - execute a package (npx parcel index.html)

#parcel
* dev build
* created local server
* HMR - hot module replacement(refreshing on its own when saved)
* File watching algorithms written in c++
* caching - faster builds
* Image optimization
* minifaction/bundling of files
* compressing
* consistent hashing(read about it)
* code splitting
* differential bundling - support older browsers
* diagonostic
* better error handling
* HTTPs
